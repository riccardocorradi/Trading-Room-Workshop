        "The below code is the same as the one above except it also sends messages every 5 seconds. This causes all clients to cancel and replace all limit orders every 5 seconds ALONGSIDE every time there's new news. Could be beneficial if we are getting both our buys and sells filled before new news comes out, would want to keep placing orders at ub and lb to \"market make\" in the meantime. Also would trigger the start of our algorithm faster if price goes outside our range, we won't be waiting for new news to set the orders. Just update the time.sleep(5) to whatever amount of seconds you want. It also Locks threading, which may make communication speed a bit faster."
